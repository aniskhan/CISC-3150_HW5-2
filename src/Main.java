	1 - Consider the call:
		Dog d = new Dog();
		System.out.println(d.call(3));
			    
		Actual method called is (circle one): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, a method from class Object, Error!
		 
		This is an example of (circle all that apply): overriding/polymorphism, overloading, it-was-an-error!
		 
	2 -	Consider the call:
		Object c = new Cat();
		System.out.println(c);
			    
		Actual method called is (circle one): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, a method from class Object, Error!
